# Interpretation(with 95% CI)

- If we repeat the same sampling method 100 times, and compute a 95% confidence interval each time…

- About 95 out of 100 intervals would contain the true population parameter.

- It does not mean “there’s a 95% chance the true mean is inside this interval” — that’s a common misconception.
